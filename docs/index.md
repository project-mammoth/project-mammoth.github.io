# Project Mammoth!
![Mammoth](https://projectmammoth.com/images/pm-logo-no-text.jpg)
## Music, Art, Tech & General Hackery

The collaboration of four siblings striving to push the boundaries of music and tech infused with art. Fueled by a passion to dissasemble, tear apart, tinker, hack and redefine the audible, visible and underlying circuitry of everyday life.
